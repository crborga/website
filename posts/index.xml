      <description>Building websites and working on computers has been a hobby of mine for about 20 years now. My web design skills are limited but as you can see I am able to code them. I would like to attend college and further educate myself in web design and pursue certifications for IT work. In my free time I play computer games and experiment with various Linux distributions.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>
